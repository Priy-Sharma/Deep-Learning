<h1>Deep Learning Models for Classification</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the repository! This project contains deep learning models designed for two types of classification tasks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Image Classification</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Text Classification</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The repository is organized into two main folders:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Image Classification</strong>: Contains models and scripts for classifying images.</li>
        <li><strong>Text Classification</strong>: Includes models and code for classifying text data.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Text Classification</h2>
    <p>For details on the text classification model, please refer to the following notebook:</p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/Priy-Sharma/Deep-Learning/blob/main/StackOverflow-TextClassification/stack.ipynb">
            Stack Overflow Text Classification Notebook
        </a>
    </p>
    <p>This notebook demonstrates the classification of Stack Overflow questions into four categories:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>C#</li>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>Python</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The model successfully classifies questions based on their content into the specified categories.</p>
